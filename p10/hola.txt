I’m an over-planner or an under-planner.

Either a) we’re involved in a military operation where we leave from your house at 7:20am (and I will break into your house and get you out of bed using ‘creative language’ if necessary), or b) I will say I’m “coming around Saturday” then show up unannounced missing a shoe and stinking of cheap whisky at 11:47pm, claiming it still counts.

Going to a Trump rally was definitely b).

    Shitting Henry.

    There is a Donald Trump rally only an hour away in Portsmouth, NH. This Saturday.

    … I kind of want to see this train wreck for myself.

    Me, last Wednesday

I don’t care that much.

A) I can’t vote, I’m not a citizen.

B) Our long-term plan doesn’t involve staying here. This breeds a disconnect with the country’s future. We won’t share it.

C) Jesus, it’s Donald Trump. I knew well before I got off the plane at Logan that he’s a millionaire donkey who plays a billionaire on television. 15 months of continuous media exposure has made him dumber and louder. He’s not Thomas Paine.

But then he blew his whole deal sky-high, with industrial-strength sexism and poor discipline. He’s braking on ice, travelling downhill, and skidding out. He’s going to hit a tree, and burn, and then it’s only so long before he flames out completely. Republicans came out and threw him overboard, hoping to save themselves from their own electoral annihilation. You don’t need me to link the obituaries by now.
